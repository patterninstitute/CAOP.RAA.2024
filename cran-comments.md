* This is a new release.
* The package slightly exceeds the size limit, and I would like to request an
exemption. The excess is minimal, and keeping the data within the package
ensures self-reliance, avoiding the need for external communication.
Additionally, the data is date-pinned, so future updates should not further
increase the package size.
